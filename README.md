# Diabetes_Prediction-And-Analysis-of-ROC-curve

**In This Repository, I put ```Jupyter File``` Which has following Topics Cover:**
```
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns
   %matplotlib inline
```
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle Null Values
- Deal with Outliers
- Scale data With ```from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler```

### 2. Build Model
- KNearestNeighbors 
  - For more accuracy Decide **n_neighbor** value.
  - **ROC CURVE** Analysis
 
- Logistic Regression
  - **ROC CURVE** Analysis
  
- Random Forest
  - **ROC CURVE** Analysis
 
### 3. Analysis of ROC CURVE (**KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest**)
